# retroTHz

A place for my future project based on my old academic project back in university.  
It was written in MATLAB, so I'll rewrite it in python with cool retrofuturistic "alien-style" interface. 
The functionality will include spectral analysis, denoising and polarimetry analysis for Thz waveforms.
